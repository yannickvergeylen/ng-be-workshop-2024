<h1 align="center">âœ¨ Nx Masterclass Workshop âœ¨ </h2>

> In this workshop we will be extending the Nx workspace containing two applications and several feature and utility libraries that represent a simple IMDB clone.
>
> Our frontend application is built with Angular and our backend is built with NestJS but we will be focusing on the Nx itself rather than the actual codebase.
>
> Feel free to change the style or business logic of those apps prior to workshop to your liking.
>
> This is what we're working with:
